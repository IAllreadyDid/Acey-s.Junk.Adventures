  *Series 428 FAQ*


      Memory

*Q1: What kind and size of cache memory configurations can I use with
the 428?*

A1: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 MB - x36(parity) - 50/60/70 ns - 72 pin -
Single-Sided Fast Page Mode SIMMS. X32 (non-parity) SIMMS are not
supported or guaranteed to work with the 428. Reference page 37 of the
old PCI RAID controller hardware manual, and page 57 of the current one.

*Q2: Can I use any brand of memory with the 428?*

A2: No. The only makes or brands confirmed for the 428 are PNY, SEC,
Tanisys, Micron Technologies, Advantage, Unigen, and Centon.


      Storage

*Q1: Is it possible to add 1 or more disks to a spanned RAID 50 or other
spanned array?*

A1: No. as listed in the manual, spanned arrays cannot be reconstructed
or single disks added to them.

*Q2: Is it possible to use the newer Ultra-2(LVD or low voltage
differential) disks with this controller?*

A2: Technically speaking, yes. However they will not run at Ultra-2
speeds. They have not been certified with the 428. Also, LVD disks will
only work if they are backward compatible and can be set to single-ended
mode, and the disk firmware allows for running in that mode or slower
modes.


      Other Devices/Components

*Q1: What is the available/acceptable lengths for the external SCSI
cables with the 428?*

A1: 428 has been confirmed for external high density 68 pin connector
cables 1 to 3 meters but can be up to 20 meters with the right
enclosure, cables, and accessories(such as the AMI 436 bus extender
device), although data transfer integrity is questionable beyond that.

*Q2: Is it possible to move NT 4.0 (or other operating systems)
installed on another SCSI card to a 428 RAID Controller card?*

A2: With NT it can possibly be done if the MegaRAID drivers are
installed first, and then the previous SCSI controller drivers removed,
the system is powered down, the disk(s) are moved to the MegaRAID, and
configured as appropriate in CTL-M. A backup of the boot disk before
trying this is recommended however. On other operating systems, such as
sco osr, this may not at all be possible because of how the boot
sector/kernel boot associations with the original controller driver
installed.

*Q3: I am having problems getting an Iomega Jazz drive and a Zip drive
to work on the 428, will these work with the MegaRAID card?*

A3: These devices were not part of the original specifications of the
MegaRAID, and therefore are not supported on the MegaRAID. However, zip
drives have worked on the MegaRAID, with mixed results.


      Features

*Q1: When a disk fails in a RAID 1, 3, or 5 array, does it rebuild
automatically when the failed disk is replaced, and does the alarm turn
off at that time?*

A1: With the exception of the most recent MegaRAID firmware, the rebuild
will not automatically start. It must be selected in CTL-M, Megamgr, or
power console. The alarm will continue to sound until the rebuild is
complete, unless it is silenced or disabled in the objects/adapter menu.

*Q2: Is it possible to reconstruct or add a disk to a RAID if there is
more than one logical drive on that array?*

A2: No. For RAID migration/reconstruction/expansion, there can be only 1
logical drive made on that array.

*Q3: How many channels does 428 card support?*

A3: The card supports 3 SCSI channels/buses, has 2 external ultra high
density connectors, and it has 3 internal high density connectors.

*Q4: Is it possible to clear one or more arrays but not all arrays from
a 428 in CTL-M, Megamgr, or Power Console?*

A4: No. The only way to delete a logical drive, currently, is to clear
the entire configuration. If you only want to delete an individual LD
that is part of a larger array and retain the data from a separate LD on
the same array this can be accomplished if the LD to be deleted is the
last one that was configured on that array.

    # Backup your data.
    # Make note of the EXACT configuration of the controller, I.E.
      Stripe Size, Raid Level, Stripe Order, Etc.
    # Delete the configuration in CTRL-M, DO NOT Initialize!
    # Recreate the original configuration with the exception of the last
      LD configured, I.E. the one that you want to delete. DO NOT
      Initialize!

If the LD you want to delete occupies an entire array the process is
generally safer. You can also use the save/load configuration options to
temporarily add logical drives. /Power Console Plus:/ Save the
configuration to a file in Power Console Plus. Add new drive(s) as
additional logical drives via PC+ or CTRL-M. Reload the original
configuration via PC+ when you want to delete the temporary logical drives.

*Q5: Virtual Sizing is also an item that can be set for each logical
drive in CTL-M, but what is it for and why when selecting virtual sizing
does the logical drive show as 80+GB in CTL-M and in the operating system?*

A5: Virtual Sizing is a feature added so that if you want to add disks
to an array at a later time to increase the size of a partition, you
can. That means it is possible to set one large operating system
partition that is of course far larger than it really is, or set it to
what is really is and later as you add disks add more partitions. It is
important however to remember how large the true hard disk size is and
to never try to write more date than there is actual hard disk space.

*Q6: How can I tell what version of the firmware and BIOS of my MegaRAID
is using?*

A6: During the system boot sequence the MegaRAID banner will appear. The
first version number that will appear is the MegaRAID BIOS version.
After the channel scan is complete, the firmware version will appear.
Also, in the CTL-M utility, the version of the utility is displayed at
the top of the screen.


      Support

*Q1: Where are updated drivers / manuals for 428?*

A1: They are available at ftp.Megatrends.com/MegaRAID /drivers.
Downloadable manuals are also available in the MegaRAID directory.

*Q2: Where are updated firmwares for 428?*

A2: As long as the requested firmware is not an OEM product, upgrades
are available upon request from tech support after discussion of the
firmware issue with a support technician.
