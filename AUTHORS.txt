The original SSD (v1.0) was written by Alan J. Russo in 1994. Some
versions of this may still be floating around. It was written to work
on a variety of Unix OSs. The debug flag name and questionable use of
the word "pedantic" are retained in tribute to Alan's original work.

Re-written in May 1999 by Carl A. Dunham (cdunham@apcc.com) to use
modern ttyS? capabilities, automake, autoconf, etc. Should run on most
Unixes, although the "make install" may not do the right thing when it
sets up the startup files.
